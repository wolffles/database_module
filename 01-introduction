1. What data types do each of these values represent?

    "A Clockwork Orange" = string
    42 = integer
    09/02/1945 = date object
    98.7 = float
    $15.99 = price object

2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

   I would use a database when I need to recall or create searches for a specific data. I would use a text file if it was a simple data, such as a list of dates or a list of names. Usually you wouldn't use a text file to store informations for entrees that have extra attributes.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

   SQL is a declarative programming language; a declarative programming language is best described as a contrast to imperative/procedural languages. declarative languages do not imply how they want an operation performed, as long as it returns the desired result. where as imperative/procedural are operations to get to the desired results. A great example is if you were to order food to go vs cooking the food yourself. Declarative would be ordering food and other languages like javascript would be the ladder.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

   A database allows users to manipulate data using an interface or console. unlike a text file the database stores its information in binary format which is only readable by the application. These binary files have a special structure which allows the application to quickly read and write to them.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

   table: A table is similar to a subject or genre, it represents the relation between the rows and columns.
   row: a row is one entry, each row's different values pertain to that specific row.
   column: a column is an attribute that all rows could have.
   value: a value is the data that is stored in the cell and it has a specific meaning depending on where it is on the table ie: where rows and columns intersect.

6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.
  1. string
  2. integer
  3. object

7. running SQL:
   SELECT date, amount
   FROM payments;
    2016-05-01	1500
    2016-05-10	37
    2016-05-15	124.93
    2016-05-23	54.72
  SELECT amount
  FROM payments
  WHERE amount > 500;
   1500
  SELECT *
  FROM payments
  WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';
   2016-05-15	 Mega Foods	 124.93	 Groceries

8. writing SQL queries:
   The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.
    SELECT email, signup
    FROM users
    WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';
    #=> datad@comcast.net	2008-01-20
   The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.
    SELECT userid
    FROM users
    WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';
    #=> 1
   All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    WHERE userid = 4;
    #=> 4	Brandy Boolean	bboolean@nasa.gov	1999-10-15
